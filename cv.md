## About myself

It's my second course at The Rolling Scope platfome. At May 2022 I have successfully finished 
**ML-INTRO-2022Q1 (DATA SCIENCE) course**.  It was great experience for me. My programmer skill have growned up. Teaching methods, princiapal and especially community of RS are really close to me. Hope with **JS/FE Pre-School 2022Q4 course** will help me to finished my currect project and obtain useful knowledge for future projects.

My goal in the nearest several years is to **impove my developer skills in web, datascience and fullstack technologies**. Also I'm interesting in improvement my interpersonal skills such as english, time-managenent, communications and etc.
